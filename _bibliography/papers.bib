  abstract     = {Building physics-based models of complex physical systems like buildings and chemical plants is extremely cost and time prohibitive for applications such as real-time optimal control, production planning and supply chain logistics.  Machine learning algorithms can reduce this cost and time complexity, and are, consequently, more scalable for large-scale physical systems. However, there are many practical challenges that must be addressed before employing machine learning for closed-loop control. This paper proposes the use of Gaussian Processes (GP) for learning control-oriented models: (1) We develop methods for the optimal experiment design (OED) of functional tests to learn models of a physical system, subject to stringent operational constraints and limited availability of the system. Using a Bayesian approach with GP, our methods seek to select the most informative data for optimally updating an existing model. (2) We also show that black-box GP models can be used for receding horizon optimal control with probabilistic guarantees on constraint satisfaction through chance constraints. (3) We further propose an online method for continuously improving the GP model in closed-loop with a real-time controller. Our methods are demonstrated and validated in a case study of building energy control and Demand Response.},

  abstract     = {Decisions on how to best optimize energy systems operations are becoming ever so complex and conflicting, that model-based predictive control (MPC) algorithms must play an important role. However, a key factor prohibiting the widespread adoption of MPC in buildings, is the cost, time, and effort associated with learning first-principles based dynamical models of the underlying physical system. This paper introduces an alternative approach for implementing finite-time receding horizon control using control-oriented data-driven models. We call this approach Data Predictive Control (DPC). Specifically, by utilizing separation of variables, two novel algorithms for implementing DPC using a single regression tree and with regression trees ensembles (random forest) are presented. The data predictive controller enables the building operator to trade off energy consumption against thermal comfort without having to learn white/grey box models of the systems dynamics. We present a comprehensive numerical study which compares the performance of DPC with an MPC based energy management strategy, using a single zone building model. Our results demonstrate that performance of DPC is comparable to an MPC controller, with only 3.8% additional cost in terms of optimal objective function and within 95% in terms of R 2 score, thereby making it an alluring alternative to MPC, whenever the associated cost of learning the model is high.},

  abstract  = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) plays an important role in optimizing operations of complex cyber-physical systems because of its ability to forecast system’s behavior and act under system level constraints. However, MPC requires reasonably accurate underlying models of the system. In many applications, such as building control for energy management, Demand Response, or peak power reduction, obtaining a high-fidelity physics-based model is cost and time prohibitive, thus limiting the widespread adoption of MPC. To this end, we propose a data-driven control algorithm for MPC that relies only on the historical data. We use multi-output regression trees to represent the system’s dynamics over multiple future time steps and formulate a finite receding horizon control problem that can be solved in real-time in closed-loop with the physical plant.

A key factor prohibiting the widespread adoption of MPC for complex systems such as buildings is related to the difficulties (cost, time and effort) associated with the identification of a predictive model of a building. To overcome this problem, we introduce a novel idea for predictive control based on historical building data leveraging machine learning algorithms like regression trees and random forests. We call this approach Data-driven model Predictive Control (DPC), and we apply it to three different case studies to demonstrate its performance, scalability and robustness. In the first case study we consider a benchmark MPC controller using a bilinear building model, then we apply DPC to a data-set simulated from such bilinear model and derive a controller based only on the data. Our results demonstrate that DPC can provide comparable performance with respect to MPC applied to a perfectly known mathematical model. In the second case study we apply DPC to a 6 story 22 zone building model in EnergyPlus, for which model-based control is not economical and practical due to extreme complexity, and address a Demand Response problem. Our results demonstrate scalability and efficiency of DPC showing that DPC provides the desired power curtailment with an average error of 3%. In the third case study we implement and test DPC on real data from an off-grid house located in L’Aquila, Italy. We compare the total amount of energy saved with respect to the classical bang-bang controller, showing that we can perform an energy saving up to 49.2%. Our results demonstrate robustness of our method to uncertainties both in real data acquisition and weather forecast.},

This has been done by estimating the errors in position and orientation of

manipulator with different path constraints for welding process to achieve

An E+ digital twin can be used to provide predictions of the building’s performance in different weather, usage, and energy pricing scenarios, which allows for accurate assessment of different control strategies.

This system has two electric machines, traction motor and boost motor, and offers an additional control variable in energy management problem i.e. the amount of electrical boost (e-boost) to reduce turbolag. The task of an optimal controller now be- comes manifold: deciding the torque split between engine and traction motor, the power of the boost motor and the gear number.

First, a control-oriented model of a parallel HEV with a turbocharged engine is derived based on first principles. After a series of investigations, a suitable method to model turbolag is proposed. It is based on a predefined map for permissible engine torque obtained through scattered interpolation of experi- mental measurements. The boost mechanism uses an electric motor coupled to the shaft of the turbocharger.

Dynamic Programming is used to solve the optimal control problem. In order to find out an optimal trade-off between the two on-board electric machines, optimal strategy is calculated with a constraint on maximum total electrical power. The circumstances in which it is advantageous to use a boost motor have been discussed. In the control problem with fuel minimization, the simula- tion results reveal that fuel consumption of an HEV without the e-boost can be reduced slightly by installing a boost mechanism only under high load require- ments. The impact of e-boost on the acceleration performance of the vehicle is more prominent. Using a fraction of the total available electrical power, a boost motor can significantly reduce the time required to accelerate from an initial speed to a given final speed.

Further, the influence of powertrain component sizes on the operation strategy has been analyzed, specifically in the problem of maximizing acceleration per- formance. A theoretical research is done by scaling the engine displacement volume for different size of turbochargers keeping the maximum engine torque and power constant, and motor map for different nominal powers. The result indicates that the benefits are inversely proportional to the size of the engine as well as the nominal power of the traction motor. This dependence is stronger on the engine size and weaker on the motor power.},
