I am a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Systems Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by Prof. [Manfred Morari](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/directory/profile.php?ID=213){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests lie in machine learning, robotics, control theory, optimization and statistics. Applications include autonomous racing and building control.

Previously, I have worked as an Applied Scientist Intern at AI Labs in Amazon Web Services, where I jointly worked with Robotics AI and AWS RoboMaker. In 2018, I co-founded Flexergy AI, a SBIR company that provides data-driven energy- and cost-efficient solutions for building control and energy analytics. In 2014, I had the pleasure of working at the Mercedes Benz Research and Development in Stuttgart, Germany in joint collaboration with the [Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control](http://www.idsc.ethz.ch){:target="_blank"}. At ETH Zurich, I also worked at the [Automatic Control Lab](https://www.control.ee.ethz.ch){:target="_blank"}. I was an Intern at ABB Corporate Research, Baden-Dättwil, Switzerland in 2013-14. ABB was kind enough to feature me on their [webpage](http://new.abb.com/ch/en/careers/career-opportunities/graduates/explorer-trainee-program){:target="blank"} :)

I received an M.S. degree in Robotics, Systems and Control from ETH Zurich, Switzerland in 2015 and a B.Tech. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India in 2012.

For my research on data-driven energy- and cost-efficient solutions for building control, I received the <span style="color:blue">Best Paper Award</span> at the International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS) 2018, the <span style="color:blue">Energy Systems Best Paper Award</span> at the American Control Conference (ACC) 2017 and the <span style="color:blue">Best Presentation Award</span> at BuildSys 2016. I am a recipient of the <span style="color:blue">Swiss Government Excellence Scholarship</span>.
